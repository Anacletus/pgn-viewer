# Lichess PGN Viewer - work in progress

Minimalistic PGN viewer widget, designed to be embedded in content pages.

This won't replace a fully featured [analysis board](https://lichess.org/analysis).

## Goals

- load and render very fast
- browse through a game
- mobile support
- translatable and customisable
- client-side only
- easy to set up on any page

### Non Goals

- custom user moves
- variation tree
- engine support
- opening explorer

For these features, use an [analysis board](https://lichess.org/analysis) or [Lichess studies](https://lichess.org/study).
